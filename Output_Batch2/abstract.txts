TI  -  b'PHOX2B Immunostaining: A Simple and Helpful Tool for the Recognition of Ganglionic Cells and Diagnosis of Hirschsprung Disease.'
AB  -  b'Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a congenital disorder of the enteric nervous system that occurs in 1 in 5000 live births. It is characterized by the absence of ganglionic cells (GCs) in the distal intestine. The diagnosis relies on the thorough analysis of a rectal suction biopsy (RSB), which must show a complete absence of GCs after careful examination of at least 100 serial sections. Such a negative characteristic explains the difficulty of this diagnosis. Moreover, GCs may be immature in very young or preterm born children, making them hard to recognize. Therefore, ancillary techniques have been developed as diagnostic help, such as acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and calretinin immunostaining. These techniques reveal only indirect clues, focusing mainly on the changes in nerve fibers, but not on GCs themselves. As PHOX2B has been shown to be a very specific transcription factor in GCs and in progenitor enteric nerve cells, we have assessed (i) PHOX2B immunostaining in immature enteric ganglia and (ii) the use of PHOX2B immunostaining for the recognition of GCs on RSBs for suspicion of HD. We have observed PHOX2B expression in all GCs, both mature and immature, and its complete absence in Hirschsprung cases. We suggest that the use of PHOX2B immunostaining is of great help (i) in the recognition of GCs on RSBs regardless of their differentiation and therefore (ii) in the diagnosis of HD.'

AB  -  b'Neuroblastoma is an example of a difficult-to-treat tumor with high incidence of relapse. DNA vaccination could be applied as a relapse prophylactic option for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Its efficacy depends directly on a target antigen of choice and a delivery method. Three neuroblastoma-associated antigens (tyrosine hydroxylase, Survivin, PHOX2B) and two delivery methods were investigated. Our data suggest that antigen PHOX2B is a more immunogenic target that induces cellular immune response and tumor regression more effectively than tyrosine hydroxylase and Survivin. Immunogenicity testing revealed that the delivery of DNA vaccine by Salmonella enterica was accompanied by a stronger immune response (cytotoxicity and IFN production) than that by DNA-polyethylenimine conjugate. Nevertheless, intramuscular immunization with PEI led to higher decrease of tumor volume compared to that after oral gavage with Salmonella vaccine.'

CIAD was also not observed with other nuclear antigens including BRG1, Pax5, Ki67, BCL6, INI-1, myogenin, MyoD1, and Phox2B. TdT CIAD seems to be specific for lymphoblastic lymphomas. CIAD is another preanalytical artifact that needs to be considered in immunohistochemistry.'

AB  -  b"Emerging evidence from multiple studies indicates that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suffer from a spectrum of autonomic and respiratory motor deficiencies in addition to the classical motor symptoms attributed to substantia nigra degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Animal models of PD show a decrease in the resting respiratory rate as well as a decrease in the number of Phox2b-expressing retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which substantia nigra pars compact (SNc) degeneration induced RTN biomolecular changes and to identify the extent to which RTN pharmacological or optogenetic stimulations rescue respiratory function following PD-induction. SNc degeneration was achieved in adult male Wistar rats by bilateral striatal 6-hydroxydopamine injection. For proteomic analysis, laser capture microdissection and pressure catapulting were used to isolate the RTN for subsequent comparative proteomic analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The respiratory parameters were evaluated by whole-body plethysmography and electromyographic analysis of respiratory muscles. The results confirmed reduction in the number of dopaminergic neurons of SNc and respiratory rate in the PD-animals. Our proteomic data suggested extensive RTN remodeling, and that pharmacological or optogenetic stimulations of the diseased RTN neurons promoted rescued the respiratory deficiency. Our data indicate that despite neuroanatomical and biomolecular RTN pathologies, that RTN-directed interventions can rescue respiratory control dysfunction."

More rarely, it can be a manifestation of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). We here describe a 25-year-old woman with severe central hypoventilation triggered by analgesics. Genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of adult-onset CCHS caused by a heterozygous de novo poly-alanine repeat expansion of the PHOX2B gene. She was treated with nocturnal non-invasive ventilation. We reviewed the literature and found 21 genetically confirmed adult-onset CCHS cases. Because of the risk of deleterious respiratory complications, adult-onset CCHS is an important differential diagnosis in patients with central hypoventilation.'

TI  -  b'Neurochemical Characterization of Brainstem Pro-Opiomelanocortin Cells.'
AB  -  b'Genetic research has revealed pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) to be a fundamental regulator of energy balance and body weight in mammals. Within the brain, POMC is primarily expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), while a smaller population exists in the brainstem nucleus of the solitary tract (POMCNTS). We performed a neurochemical characterization of this understudied population of POMC cells using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of a POMC promoter/enhancer (PomceGFP). Expression of endogenous Pomc mRNA in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) PomceGFP cells was confirmed using fluorescence-activating cell sorting (FACS) followed by quantitative PCR. In situ hybridization histochemistry of endogenous Pomc mRNA and immunohistochemical analysis of eGFP revealed that POMC is primarily localized within the caudal NTS. Neurochemical analysis indicated that POMCNTS is not co-expressed with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nesfatin, nitric oxide synthase 1 (nNOS), seipin, or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) cells, whereas 100% of POMCNTS is co-expressed with transcription factor paired-like homeobox2b (Phox2b). We observed that 20% of POMCNTS cells express receptors for adipocyte hormone leptin (LepRbs) using a PomceGFP:LepRbCre:tdTOM double-reporter line. Elevations in endogenous or exogenous leptin levels increased the in vivo activity (c-FOS) of a small subset of POMCNTS cells. Using ex vivo slice electrophysiology, we observed that this effect of leptin on POMCNTS cell activity is postsynaptic. These findings reveal that a subset of POMCNTS cells are responsive to both changes in energy status and the adipocyte hormone leptin, findings of relevance to the neurobiology of obesity.'

However, its roles in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) progression are still unclear. This work aims to explore the roles of AGK in NPC cell stemness. It was shown that AGK expression was higher in NPC tissues compared to the adjacent tissues. Online dataset analysis revealed that AGK expression was negatively correlated with the overall survival of NPC patients. Gain and loss of functional experiments demonstrated that AGK positively regulated the stemness of NPC cells, as evident by the change of the tumor sphere-formation ability, ALDH1 activity and expression of stemness critical regulators. KEGG analysis were performed to determine the potential pathways of AGK involved in NPC cell stemness and showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway exhibited the most correlation with AGK expression. Further mechanistic studies confirmed that AGK promoted the stemness of NPC cells through activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, and thus enhancing -catenin accumulation in nucleus. This study demonstrates a novel AGK/PI3K/Akt/-catenin axis involving in NPC cell stemness.'

AB  -  b'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder in reproductive women and is characterized by polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. Abnormal folliculogenesis is considered as a common characteristic of PCOS. Our aim is to identify the altered circRNA expression profile in exosomes isolated from follicular fluid (FF) of PCOS patients to investigate the molecular function of exosomal circRNA, as a vital mediator in follicular microenvironment, in the aetiology and pathobiology of PCOS. In this study, the circRNA expression profile of FF exosomes were compared between PCOS and control patients by RNA sequencing (N=5 vs 5). Sixteen circRNAs showed significantly different expression. GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that their parental genes were enriched in PCOS-related pathways, including ovarian steroidogenesis, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, and Jak-STAT signaling. Among sixteen differentially expressed circRNAs, hsa_circ_0006877 (circLDLR) was processed from its parental LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) transcript, which participated in ovarian steroidogenesis. Its depletion in PCOS FF exosomes was further verified in an additional cohort (N=25 vs 25) by qRT-PCR. And a circLDLR-miR-1294-CYP19A1 competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was predicted by cytoscape software, and confirmed by luciferase assay and correlative expression in the cumulus cells of PCOS patients. Mechanistically, the intercellular transfer of functional circLDLR assay and its withdrawal experiments in KGN cells showed that depleting circLDLR in exosomes increased miR-1294 expression and inhibited CYP19A1 expression in recipient cells, as well as reduced their estrogen (E2) secretion. Our findings revealed a ceRNA network of circLDLR and provided new information on abnormal follicle development in PCOS.'

The pathogenic mechanism has not been fully elucidated, and there are no effective biomarkers for endometriosis. In our study, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of 10 ectopic endometrial plasma from patients with ovarian endometriosis and 10 normal plasma from healthy controls was analyzed using a microarray. As a result, 114 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. Among them, 14 miRNAs were significantly downregulated in patients with ovarian endometriosis, which matched the microarray results. The diagnostic value of the 14 downregulated miRNAs in ovarian endometriosis was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and hsa-let-7i-5p showed the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) with a value of 0.900. The target genes of the 14 miRNAs were predicted by miRWalk2.0, and the genes that were targeted by at least 2 of the 14 miRNAs were analyzed by function enrichment. The target genes were significantly enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, such as microRNAs in cancer, bladder cancer, and endocrine resistance pathways, and the Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process, cellular nitrogen compound biosynthetic process, and heterocycle metabolic process.

AB  -  b'BACKGROUND The underlying mechanism of insulin resistance is complex; bioinformatics analysis is used to explore the mechanism based differential expression genes (DEGs) obtained from omics analysis. However, the expression and role of most DEGs involved in bioinformatics analysis are invalidated. This study aimed to disclose the mechanism of insulin resistance via bioinformatics analysis based on validated insulin resistance-related genes (IRRGs) collected from public disease-gene databases. MATERIAL AND METHODS IRRGs were collected from 4 disease databases including NCBI-Gene, CTD, RGD, and Phenopedia. GO and KEGG analysis of IRRGs were performed by DAVID. Then, the STRING database was employed to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of IRRGs. The module analysis and hub genes identification were carried out by MCODE and cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape based on the primary PPI network, respectively. RESULTS A total of 1195 IRRGs were identified. Response to drug, hypoxia, insulin, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, negative regulation of apoptotic process, glucose homeostasis, cellular response to insulin stimulus, and aging were proposed as the crucial functions related to insulin resistance. Ten insulin resistance-related pathways included the pathways of insulin resistance, pathways in cancer, adipocytokine, prostate cancer, PI3K-Akt, insulin, AMPK, HIF-1, prolactin, and pancreatic cancer signaling pathway were revealed. INS, AKT1, IL-6, TP53, TNF, VEGFA, MAPK3, EGFR, EGF, and SRC were identified as the top 10 hub genes. CONCLUSIONS The current study presented a landscape view of possible underlying mechanism of insulin resistance by bioinformatics analysis based on validated IRRGs.'

This study integrated three expression profile datasets (GSE55235, GSE12021, and GSE55457) and one methylation profile dataset GSE111942 to elucidate the potential essential candidate genes and pathways in RA. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylation genes (DMGs) were identified by R programming software, using Limma package and ChAMP package, respectively. DAVID performed gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. Functional annotation and construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the Molecular Complex Detection Algorithm (MCODE) were analysed by STRING and Cystoscope, respectively. Then the connection analysis of DEGs and DMGs was carried out, and further to analyse the relationship between methylation and gene expression, aiming to screen out the potential genes. In this study, 288 DEGs and 228 DMGs were identified, and the majority of DEGs were up-regulated. Enrichment analysis represented that DEGs mainly involved immune response and participated in the Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signal pathway. 282 nodes were identified from DEGs PPI network and MCODE, filtering the most significant 2 modules, 23 core node genes were identified and most of them are involved in the T cell receptor signalling pathway and chemokine-mediated signalling pathway.

AB  -  b'Exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) might induce lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis, but the roles of physicochemical properties of MWCNTs, as well as the mechanisms, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated lipid laden foam formation in THP-1 macrophages exposed to MWCNTs of different diameters, and attempted transcriptomic analysis to study the possible mechanisms. We observed diameter-dependent cytotoxicity, lipid accumulation and intracellular reactive oxygen species production that were more pronounced for MWCNTs with smaller diameters compared with those with larger diameters. However, more MWCNTs with larger diameters were retained in macrophages after 24h exposure. One possible explanation for the inverse relationship between MWCNT bio-effects and internalization is that macrophages altered the expression of exocytotic genes to export toxic MWCNTs. Transcriptomic data showed that MWCNTs with smaller diameters more effectively altered the expression of genes related with cytotoxicity and lipid metabolism, and KEGG pathway analysis suggested that MWCNTs with smaller diameters activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathway (map03320), leading to over-expression of perilipin 2, the surface proteins of LDs. Western blot confirmed that MWCNTs effectively promoted CD36, PPAR and perilipin 2, key components in map03320. Moreover, inhibition of PPAR by chemicals or siRNA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation induced by MWCNTs with smaller diameters, and perilipin 2 proteins in MWCNT-exposed macrophages could be decreased by PPAR siRNA. In conclusion, the results of this study revealed the induction of LDs by MWCNTs in a diameter-dependent manner through the activation of PPAR signalling pathway.'

Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been reported to be closely associated with various diseases, but their roles in TBI has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanism of LncRNA HOTAIR in TBI-induced microglial activation and inflammatory factor release. In vivo mouse TBI model and in vitro microglia activation model were established by Feeney's free-fall impact method and by LPS stimulation, respectively. The expression of LncRNA HOTAIR in activated microglia was detected by qRT-PCR. After shRNA knocked down, the expressions of LncRNA HOTAIR and microglia activation marker Iba-1 in microglia were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot and by ELISA that detected the concentration of inflammatory factor in cell culture supernatants. The relationship between LncRNA HOTAIR and MYD88 in mouse microglia BV2 cells was observed by RNA pull-down assay. Furthermore, the effect of LncRNA HOTAIR on MYD88 stability was assessed by cycloheximide (CHX)-chase and by immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays that analyzed MYD88 ubiquitination. LncRNA HOTAIR was abnormally highly expressed in activated microglia. By Western blot and ELISA, the knockdown of LncRNA HOTAIR in microglia significantly repressed microglia activation and inflammatory factor release. By RNA pull-down assay, LncRNA HOTAIR could bind to MYD88 protein. Besides, by cycloheximide (CHX)-chase and immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays, the overexpression of the LncRNA HOTAIR enhanced the stability of MYD88 protein and inhibited Nrdp1-mediated ubiquitination of MYD88 protein. After thetransfection of shRNA-HOTAIR and shRNA-HOTAIR+pcDNA-MYD88 into microglia, shRNA-HOTAIR could significantly inhibit the activation of microglia and the release of inflammatory factors, while these effects were reversed after the transfection of pcDNA-MYD88. Our experimental data indicated that LncRNA HOTAIR was highly expressed in activated microglia, and our further studies had found that theinterference with LncRNA HOTAIR could repress microglia activation and inflammatory factor release via promoting Nrdp1-mediated ubiquitination of MYD88 protein."

AB  -  b'Local transplantation of epidermal stem cells (ESCs) exerts a therapeutic effect on burn wounds. However, cell viability can impede their clinical application. HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is involved in regulating adult tissue stem cells, as well as in developmental patterning and pluripotency. However, little is known about its role in regulating ESCs. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of HOTAIR in the modulation of ESCs and wound repair. Firstly, reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR was used to detect the relative expression of HOTAIR during burn wound healing in mice to determine whether HOTAIR is associated with wound healing. Subsequently, ESCs derived from mouse skin were transfected with a lentiviral vector to overexpress or knockdown HOTAIR. The effects of HOTAIR on cell proliferation and differentiation were measured by 5bromodeoxyuridine and MTT assays, and by assessing NANOG mRNA expression. Lastly, mice with burns were administered a subcutaneous injection of HOTAIRoverexpressing ESCs. Images were captured and histological analyses were performed to evaluate wound healing. The results revealed that the expression of HOTAIR gradually increased and peaked atday7 postburn and maintained at relatively high levels until day14 postburn during wound healing. Furthermore, overexpression of HOTAIR promoted ESC proliferation and maintained the stem cell state invitro. By contrast, suppression of HOTAIR inhibited cell proliferation and cell stemness. It was also identified that HOTIRoverexpressing ESCs accelerated reepithelialization and facilitated burn wound repair. In conclusion, the present findings confirmed an essential role of HOTAIR in the regulation of ESC proliferation and stemness. Therefore, targeting HOTAIR in ESCs may be a potentially promising therapy for burn wound healing.'

Based on the results of the ultrasound examination, 53 patients were allocated to the metastasis-negative group, and 36 to the metastasis-positive group. The expression level of lncRNA-HOTAIR was higher in the metastasis-positive group than that in the metastasis-negative group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, cell proliferation was reduced while cell migration rate and the number of migrating cells were increased in the siRNA group. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of WIF1 and E-cadherin were significantly increased, while the levels of -catenin and vimentin were significantly decreased. In conclusion, lncRNA-HOTAIR is overexpressed in the serum of patients with lymph node metastasis of PTC. '

AB  -  b'Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as LINC00462, HOTAIR, and MALAT1, are significantly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. However, lncRNA expression in the serum of HCC patients is still unclear. To identify candidate lncRNAs for HCC diagnosis, we purified exosomal total RNA from the serum of healthy volunteers (controls) and hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC patients. To assess the function of lncRNAs, small interfering RNAs and overexpression vectors were designed and cell viability and cell apoptosis assays conducted. The exosomes of the control group had a larger number of lncRNAs with a high amount of alternative splicing compared to hepatic disease patients. qPCR assays showed that lnc-FAM72D-3, lnc-GPR89B-15, lncZEB2-19, and lnc-EPC1-4 are differentially expressed in HCC. Furthermore, the expression level of lnc-EPC1-4 correlated with age. While the expression levels of lnc-GPR89B-15 and lnc-EPC1-4 correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein level. '

AB  -  b'The relationship between the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression and oesophageal cancer prognosis has been widely studied, but less consensus has been reached. We conducted this study to evaluate the relationship between the expression of lncRNAs and the prognosis and clinical pathology of oesophageal cancer. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library until 25 January 2019. Studies that evaluated the associations of a specific lncRNA with survival and/or clinicopathology of oesophageal cancer were included. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random-effect models. Sensitivity analysis was used to verify the stability of results. Publication bias was detected usingBegg tests and adjusted utilizing the trim-and-fill method if a bias existed. A total of 51 studies comprising 6510 patients and regarding 41 lncRNAs were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. The results showed that dysregulation of lncRNAs was associated with overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free survival. The expression of lncRNAs was related to some certain clinicopathological parameters of oesophageal cancer, including tumour size, T classification, lymph node metastasis, tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage and differentiation. Among these findings, lncRNA AK001796, CASC9, HOTAIR, MALAT1 and UCA1 were identified and were expected to be ideal biomarkers for the prognosis and clinicopathology of oesophageal cancer. Although significant publication bias was observed in some studies, the results were not changed after adjustment using the trim-and-fill method. Abnormal lncRNA-expression profiles could serve as a promising indicator for prognostic evaluation of patients with oesophageal cancer. The combination of these lncRNAs will contribute to clinical decision-making in the future.'

AB  -  b'Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. Although a number of environmental and lifestyle-related risk factors have been identified for this kind of cancer, the exact molecular mechanisms of tumor evolution have not been clarified yet. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) as important regulators of gene expression and chromatin configuration have essential roles in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. They have been shown to alter the function of cancer-related signaling pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B and Wnt pathway, thus they might modulate the response of patients to pathway-targeted therapies. Moreover, a number of lncRNAs, such as AFAP1-AS1, UCA1, HOTAIR, LOC285194, and TUSC7, are involved in conferring chemoresistant/radioresistant in esophageal cancer cells. A complex network of interaction exists between lncRNAs and miRNAs in the context of esophageal cancer. Finally, various panels of lncRNAs and miRNAs have been introduced that can predict the survival of esophageal cancer patients. In this review article, we summarize the recent findings regarding the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer with the special focus on their regulatory roles on signaling pathways, their potential as diagnostic/prognostic markers, and their relevance with therapeutic response.'

AB  -  b'Pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are classified into low-grade neuroendocrine tumors and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). There are significant differences in therapeutic strategies of the different NEN subtypes, and therefore, precise classification of pulmonary NENs is critical. However, challenges in pulmonary NEN classification include overlap of diagnostic histological features among the subtypes and reduced or negative expression of neuroendocrine markers in poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Recently, transcription factor insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) was identified as a sensitive marker of neuroendocrine and neuroepithelial differentiation. In this study, INSM1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in greater than 94% of pulmonary NENs, indicating that it is a highly sensitive marker of pulmonary NENs and is useful to detect poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Although there are well-established morphological and immunohistologic criteria to diagnose pulmonary NENs, there is no universal consensus regarding prognostic markers of pulmonary NENs. Studies have shown that non-small cell lung cancers express long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate gene expression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and carcinogenesis. We characterized expression and function of lncRNAs, including HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) in pulmonary NENs, including typical carcinoid tumors, atypical carcinoid tumors, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC/NEC), and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC/NEC). In situ hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reaction studies showed higher expression (p<0.01) of all lncRNAs in SCLC/NEC. Small interfering RNA studies indicated a role for MEG3 and PCA3 in tumor proliferation. Therefore, these lncRNAs may serve as prognostic indicators of pulmonary NEN aggressiveness and as possible therapeutic targets.'

Identifying men at higher risk of developing PCa, differentiating indolent from aggressive disease and predicting the likelihood of progression will improve decision-making and selection for active surveillance protocols. Biomarkers have been utilized for PCa screening and predicting cancer behavior and response to treatment. The prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening helps detect PCa in early stages, while implementing a plan for management and outcome. However, PSA screening is still controversial, due to the risks of over diagnosis and treatment, and its inability to detect a good proportion of advanced tumors. Alternatively, a new era of PCa biomarkers has emerged with higher PCa specificity than PSA and its isoforms hopefully improving screening methods, such as Prostate Health Index (PHI) score, Progensa Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3), Mi-Prostate Score (MiPS), Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA), 4Kscore test, and Urokinase Plasminogen Activation (uPA and uPAR).

Here, we screen gliomas for POSTN expression and identify the cells that express periostin in human gliomas. In addition, we study the role of periostin in an in vitro model for angiogenesis. The expression of periostin was investigated by RT-PCR and by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we used double labeling and in situ RNA techniques to identify the expressing cells. To investigate the function of periostin, we silenced POSTN in a 3D in vitro angiogenesis model. Periostin expression was elevated in pilocytic astrocytoma and glioblastoma, but not in grade II/III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. The expression of periostin colocalized with PDGFR+ cells, but not with OLIG2+/SOX2+ glioma stem cells. Silencing of periostin in pericytes in coculture experiments resulted in attenuation of the numbers and the length of the vessels formation and in a decrease in endothelial junction formation. We conclude that pericytes are the main source of periostin in human gliomas and that periostin plays an essential role in the growth and branching of blood vessels. Therefore, periostin should be explored as a novel target for developing anti-angiogenic therapy for glioma.'

AB  -  b'The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a diverse microenvironment that maintains bidirectional communication with surrounding cells to regulate cell and tissue homeostasis. The classical definition of the ECM has more recently been extended to include non-fibrillar proteins that either interact or are structurally affiliated with the ECM, termed the \'matrisome.\' In addition to providing the structure and architectural support for cells and tissue, the matrisome serves as a reservoir for growth factors and cytokines, as well as a signaling hub via which cells can communicate with their environment and vice-versa. The matrisome is a master regulator of tissue homeostasis and organ function, which can dynamically and appropriately respond to any stress or injury. Failure to properly regulate these responses can lead to changes in the matrisome that are maladaptive. Hepatic fibrosis is a canonical example of ECM dyshomeostasis, leading to accumulation of predominantly collagenous ECM; indeed, hepatic fibrosis is considered almost synonymous with collagen accumulation. However, the qualitative and quantitative alterations of the hepatic matrisome during fibrosis are much more diverse than simple accumulation of collagens and occur long before fibrosis is histologically detected. A deeper understanding of the hepatic matrisome and its response to injury could yield new mechanistic insights into disease progression and regression, as well as potentially identify new biomarkers for both. In this review, we discuss the role of the ECM in liver diseases and look at new "omic" approaches to study this compartment.'

Glioblastoma patients have poor prognosis, with an average survival period of approximately 14 mo after diagnosis. To date, there are a limited number of effective treatment methods for glioblastoma, and its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this article, we analyzed the key biomarkers and pathways in glioblastoma patients based on gene expression and DNA methylation datasets. The 60 hypomethylated/upregulated genes and 110 hypermethylated/downregulated genes were identified in GSE50923, GSE50161, and GSE116520 microarrays. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that these methylated-differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in collagen fibril organization, chemical synaptic transmission, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and GABAergic synapse. The hub genes were screened from a protein-protein interaction network; in selected genes, increased NMB mRNA level was associated with favorable overall survival, while elevated CHI3L1, POSTN, S100A4, LOX, S100A11, IGFBP2, SLC12A5, VSNL1, and RGS4 mRNA levels were associated with poor overall survival in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, CHI3L1, S100A4, LOX, and S100A11 expressions were negatively correlated with their corresponding methylation status. Furthermore, the receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis indicated that CHI3L1, S100A4, LOX, and S100A11 can also serve as highly specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarkers for glioblastoma patients. Collectively, our study revealed the possible methylated-differentially expressed genes and associated pathways in glioblastoma and identified four DNA methylation-based biomarkers of glioblastoma.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of periostin (postn) on pyroptosis in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). To this end, the differentially expressed genes were obtained from the GSE4105 dataset using the "GEO2R" online tool. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database, and Module and Go analysis were conducted using the Cytoscape 3.6 plugs-in MCODE and BINGO, respectively. The analysis showed that postn was a critical gene in the most significant module. Experimental results, including triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, pathological analysis, TUNEL staining, western blotting, and RT-qPCR assays, showed that MIRI induced caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Postn was significantly upregulated in the heart tissues of MIRI rats and in H9C2 cells following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. In addition, knockdown of postn suppressed the caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis and H/R-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by flow cytometry, CCK8, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA assays. In contrast, overexpression of postn promoted NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis of H/R-treated H9C2 cells. According to the results of rescue experiments, a caspase-1 inhibitor reduced the increase in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis induced by overexpression of postn, and the pyroptosis-promoting function of postn overexpression in H/R treated H9C2 cells was reversed by inhibition of NLRP3. In conclusion, postn overexpression promoted the caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis during MIRI by activating the NLRP3.'

The authors report the case of a 15-year-old girl affected by CHD2-related myoclonic encephalopathy and BLM haploinsufficiency due to a deletion of 15q25.3q26.2 region, who suffered from secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH) after a VNS wound infection.

AB  -  b'Thymic epithelial tumors (TET) including thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare, but they are common primary tumors in the anterior mediastinum. The etiology and tumorigenesis of TET remain unclear. To better understand the novel aberrations of this rare tumor and provide more significant mutation sites for targeted therapy, we performed next-generation sequencing detection on 55 patients with TET. Our results showed that most genes in 12 core pathways harbored aberrations of indeterminate potential. In 4 genes (ARID1A, KMT2C, TGFBR2 and MAP3K1), the indel frequency was above 90%. Dozens of genes, including TGFBR2, KMT2C, PRKDC, ATR, CHD2, SDHA, KDM5A, CHEK1, MSH6 and POLE, possessed frameshift indel with different frequencies in different hotspot sites, which could be the new targets of therapy for TET. For the first time, we revealed a strong correlation between the tumor mutational burden and single nucleotide variations, but not frameshift, on DNA mismatch repair gene MSH6 in TET.'

TI  -  b'Dravet syndrome as part of the clinical and genetic spectrum of sodium channel epilepsies and encephalopathies.'
AB  -  b'Dravet syndrome is the most studied form of genetic epilepsy. It has now been clarified that the clinical spectrum of the syndrome does not have firmly established boundaries. The core phenotype is characterized by intractable, mainly clonic, seizures precipitated by increased body temperature with onset in the first year of life and subsequent appearance of multiple seizures types still precipitated by, but not confined to, hyperthermia. Cognitive impairment is invariably present when the full syndrome is manifested. This complex of symptoms is related to mutations in the SCN1A gene, which are often de novo and constitutional but can also be inherited from a parent with less severe clinical manifestations or be present as somatic mosaicism. Inheritance from less severely affected individuals, at times only having experienced a few febrile seizures, and differences in severity, even within the same family, with a subset of patients only showing fragments of the syndrome, testify to a remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity as far as severity, but less so clinical phenomenology, are concerned. This characteristic, together with underascertainment of SCN1A mutations due to human errors or technical limitations in uncovering alternative pathogenic molecular mechanisms, such as genomic rearrangements or poison exons, has contributed to making clinicians and geneticists suspicious that Dravet syndrome may be caused by more than one gene. This opinion has been further amplified by the description of other genetic disorders, such as PCDH19- or CHD2-related epilepsy, whose phenotypes have included fragments of the Dravet phenotypic spectrum, and by the suboptimal characterization of phenotypes associated with mutations in SCN1B, HCN1, KCN2A, GABRA1, GABRG2, and STXBP1. The SCN1A gene-Dravet syndrome association is in our opinion highly specific. However, because the syndrome spectrum is wide, fragments of it can at times also be manifested in other genetic epilepsy syndromes, thereby leading to overdiagnosis of Dravet syndrome beyond SCN1A. Dravet syndrome is in turn a severe SCN1A phenotype within a continuum of SCN1A-related clinical phenomenology.'

AB  -  b'The sulfur atom of phosphorothioated DNA (PT-DNA) is coordinated by a surface cavity in the conserved sulfur-binding domain (SBD) of type IV restriction enzymes. However, some SBDs cannot recognize the sulfur atom in some sequence contexts. To illustrate the structural determinants for sequence specificity, we resolved the structure of SBDSpr, from endonuclease SprMcrA, in complex with DNA of GPSGCC, GPSATC and GPSAAC contexts. Structural and computational analyses explained why it binds the above PT-DNAs with an affinity in a decreasing order. The structural analysis of SBDSpr-GPSGCC and SBDSco-GPSGCC, the latter only recognizes DNA of GPSGCC, revealed that a positively charged loop above the sulfur-coordination cavity electrostatically interacts with the neighboring DNA phosphate linkage. The structural analysis indicated that the DNA-protein hydrogen bonding pattern and weak non-bonded interaction played important roles in sequence specificity of SBD protein. Exchanges of the positively-charged amino acid residues with the negatively-charged residues in the loop would enable SBDSco to extend recognization for more PT-DNA sequences, implying that type IV endonucleases can be engineered to recognize PT-DNA in novel target sequences.'

AB  -  b'Shwachman-Diamond syndrome characterized by metaphyseal dysplasia, pancreatic insufficiency, and pancytopenia is caused by biallelic mutations in SBDS. Gene conversion between SBDS and its pseudogene SBDSP1 is the major cause. Here, we report two unrelated patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome who were shown to be compound heterozygotes for relatively frequent pathogenic alleles (the 258+2T>C allele and another allele composed of 183-184TA>CT and 201A>G) using an established polymerase chain reaction sequencing assay with SBDS-specific primers. Exome analysis of the patients showed discrepant results: 258+2T>C with variant allele frequency around 0.85, and no variants detected for the 183-184TA>CT allele. Parental exome analysis of the two families further supported this notion. Confronted with two patients with an unexpected segregation pattern, we performed a transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood-derived mRNA to demonstrate that the results were compatible with those obtained using SBDS-specific PCR primers. Both alleles could be accounted for by gene conversion events. The diagnostic discrepancy can be accounted for by a decreased efficiency in the computational mapping of the reads with 183-184TA>CT and 201A>G to the reference sequence of the SBDS locus during exome analysis. This report highlights the pitfall of exome analysis for genes with pseudogenes, such as SBDS and the alternative use of RNA-seq is recommended to circumvent this problem.'

AB  -  b'The Shwachman-Bodian Diamond syndrome (SBDS)-associated gene, SBDS, is involved in rRNA synthesis and ribosome maturation, but the role of SBDS in cancer is largely elusive. In this study, we found that SBDS is often overexpressed or amplified in human cancers, and high level of endogenous SBDS is significantly associated with unfavorable prognosis. Conversely, knockdown of SBDS leads to p53 stabilization and activation through the ribosomal stress-RPL5/RPL11-MDM2 pathway, resulting in the repression of cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Interestingly, ectopic SBDS in the nucleoplasm also suppresses tumor cell growth and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ectopically expressed SBDS triggered by, for example, ribosomal stress binds to the transactivation domain of p53 and perturbs the MDM2-p53 interaction, consequently leading to impaired p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Altogether, our finding for the first time demonstrates the dual functions of SBDS in cancer development by coordinating ribosome biogenesis and p53 activity.'

It has been known that DM negatively affects motion of zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, little is known in relation to the impacts of DM on development of swim bladder, which is a key organ for motion. In the present study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 20 and 40g/L DM. The changes of swim bladder morphology were observed and transcription levels of key genes were compared between DM treatments and the control. The results showed that DM treatments significantly blocked the formation of progenitor and tissue layers in swim bladder of zebrafish embryos, leading to failed inflation of swim bladder. Compared with the control, the key genes (pbx1, foxA3, mnx1, has2, anxa5b, hprt1l and elovl1a) responsible for swim bladder development also showed decreased levels in response to DM treatments, suggesting that DM might specifically affect swim bladder development. Moreover, transcription levels of genes in the Wnt (wnt5b, tcf3a, wnt1, wnt9b, fzd1, fzd3 and fzd5) and Hedgehog (ihhb, ptc1 and ptc2) signaling pathways all decreased significantly in response to DM treatments, compared with the control. Considering the importance of Wnt and Hedgehog pathways in development of swim bladder, these results suggested that DM might affect swim bladder development through inhibiting the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways. Overall, the present study reported that swim bladder might be a potential target organ of DM toxicity in zebrafish, which contributed more information to the evaluation of DM's environmental risks."

TI  -  b'Combinatorial Developmental Controls on Striatonigral Circuits.'
AB  -  b'Cortical pyramidal cells are generated locally, from pre-programmed progenitors, to form functionally distinct areas. By contrast, striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are generated remotely from a common source, undergo migration to form mosaics of striosomes and matrix, and become incorporated into functionally distinct sectors. Striatal circuits might thus have a unique logic of developmental organization, distinct from those of the neocortex. We explore this possibility in mice by mapping one set of SPNs, those in striosomes, with striatonigral projections to the dopamine-containing substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Same-age SPNs exhibit topographic striatonigral projections, according to their resident sector. However, the different birth dates of resident SPNs within a given sector specify the destination of their axons within the SNpc. These findings highlight a logic intercalating birth date-dependent and birth date-independent factors in determining the trajectories of SPN axons and organizing specialized units of striatonigral circuitry that could influence behavioral expression and vulnerabilities to disease.'

However, the potential role of DLXs methylation in myeloid neoplasms such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains to be elucidated. Clinical significance of DLXs methylation/expression was analyzed in patient with AML and MDS. The functional roles of DLXs were determined in vitro. In the identification stage, we found that lower DLX5 expression was correlated with prognosis in AML among all DLXs analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. In the validation stage, we revealed that reduced DLX5 expression was frequently occurred, and was also correlated with promoter hypermethylation in AML evaluated by targeted bisulfite sequencing. Epigenetic studies also showed that DLX5 promoter DNA methylation was associated with its expression. By quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we also validated that DLX5 hypermethylation was frequent event in both AML and MDS, and also correlated with MDS transformation to leukemia. Moreover, DLX5 hypermethylation was associated with lower rate of complete remission and shorter time of leukemia-free/overall survival, and was also confirmed by Logistic/Cox regression analysis. Functional studies revealed the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of DLX5 in MDS-derived AML cell-line SKM-1. Finally, bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that DLX5 functioned in leukemogenesis may be through the association with PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that DLX5 methylation, negatively correlated DLX5 expression, was a potential prognostic and predictive indicator in patients with AML and MDS, which could also act as an epigenetic driver in myeloid neoplasms.'

These problems were never fully elucidated. We found that mice lacking DLX1 and DLX2 (Dlx1/2-/- mice) had slower small bowel transit and reduced or absent neurally mediated contraction complexes. In contrast, small bowel motility seemed normal in adult mice lacking DLX1 (Dlx1-/-). Even with detailed anatomic studies, we found no defects in ENS precursor migration, or neuronal and glial density in Dlx1/2-/- or Dlx1-/- mice. However, RNA sequencing of Dlx1/2-/- ENS revealed dysregulation of many genes, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip). Using immunohistochemistry and reporter mice, we then found that Dlx1/2-/- mice have reduced VIP expression and fewer VIP-lineage neurons in their ENS. Our study reveals what we believe is a novel connection between Dlx genes and Vip and highlights the observation that dangerous bowel motility problems can occur in the absence of easily identifiable ENS structural defects.

AB  -  b'Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder with variable expressivity and locus heterogeneity. Despite several RAS pathway genes were implicated in NS, 20-30% of patients remain without molecular diagnosis, suggesting the involvement of further genes or multiple mechanisms. Eight patients out of 60, negative for conventional NS mutation analysis, with heterogeneous NS phenotype were investigated by means of target resequencing of 26 RAS/MAPK pathway genes. A trio was further characterized by means of whole-exome sequencing. Protein modeling and in silico prediction of protein stability allowed to identify possible pathogenic RAS pathway variants in four NS patients. A new c.355T>C variant in LZTR1 was found in patient 43. Two patients co-inherited variants in LRP1 and LZTR1 (patient 53), or LRP1 and SOS1 genes (patient 67). The forth patient (56) carried a compound heterozygote of RASAL3 gene variants and also an A2ML1 variant. While these subclinical variants are singularly present in healthy parents, they co-segregate in patients, suggesting their addictive effect and supporting a digenic inheritance, as alternative model to a more common monogenic transmission. The ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK activation state, assessed on immortalized lymphocytes from patients 53 and 67 showed highest phosphorylation levels compared to their asymptomatic parents. These findings together with the lack of their co-occurrence in the 1000Genomes database strengthen the hypothesis of digenic inheritance in a subset of NS patients. This study suggests caution in the exclusion of subclinical variants that might play a pathogenic role providing new insights for alternative hereditary mechanisms.'

AB  -  b'The human 22q11.2 chromosomal deletion is one of the strongest identified genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Although the deletion spans a number of known genes, the contribution of each of these to the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) is not known. To investigate the effect of individual genes within this interval on the pathophysiology associated with the deletion, we analyzed their role in sleep, a behavior affected in virtually all psychiatric disorders, including the 22q11.2 DS. We identified the gene LZTR1 (night owl, nowl) as a regulator of night-time sleep in Drosophila. In humans, LZTR1 has been associated with Ras-dependent neurological diseases also caused by Neurofibromin-1 (Nf1) deficiency. We show that Nf1 loss leads to a night-time sleep phenotype nearly identical to that of nowl loss and that nowl negatively regulates Ras and interacts with Nf1 in sleep regulation. Furthermore, nowl is required for metabolic homeostasis, suggesting that LZTR1 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to obesity associated with the 22q11.2 DS. Knockdown of nowl or Nf1 in GABA-responsive sleep-promoting neurons elicits the sleep phenotype, and this defect can be rescued by increased GABAA receptor signaling, indicating that Nowl regulates sleep through modulation of GABA signaling. Our results suggest that nowl/LZTR1 may be a conserved regulator of GABA signaling important for normal sleep that contributes to the 22q11.2 DS.'

TI  -  b'Germline Mutations for Novel Candidate Predisposition Genes in Sporadic Schwannomatosis.'
AB  -  b'Schwannomatosis is a late-onset tumor predisposition syndrome associated with the development of many different types of malignancies. A relevant genetic mechanism can be explained by three mutational events. The first-hit mutation is a germline mutation, and the SMARCB1 mutation on chromosome 22 is the most well-known genetic abnormality in patients with schwannomatosis. LZTR1 is another major predisposing gene in 22q-related schwannomatosis that lacks SMARCB1 variants. Although these two variants account for the occurrence of most familiar schwannomatoses, the genetic causes of sporadic schwannomatosis for the most part remain unknown. Therefore, current molecular diagnostic criteria cannot completely explain the basis of this disease. The common genetic background between schwannomatosis and other related malignant tumors is also unclear. Moreover, it is not easy to explain various clinical manifestations by only two known mutations. QUESTION/PURPOSES: (1) Are there important sequences outside the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 region on chromosome 22 that might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition to sporadic schwannomatosis? Or are there alternative evolutionarily conserved loci that might carry a first-hit mutational predisposition? (2) Is the age of disease onset associated to such genetic variants?'

His father and son had both been diagnosed with spinal tumors, and his son's tumor was pathologically diagnosed as a schwannoma. Brain MRI of his son demonstrated no intracranial tumor. Brain MRI of the patient revealed a multilobular tumor of 2 cm diameter compressing the optic nerve medially within the left muscle cone, and no other intracranial tumors. However, large masses lateral to the pharynx and intercostal nerve, as well as multiple spinal tumors were detected. Transcranial total resection of the intraorbital tumor was performed. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with a schwannoma. These clinical characteristics fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of familial schwannomatosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. His visual dysfunction and eye movement disorder resolved completely. The intraorbital tumor was believed to originate from the lacrimal nerve.

AB  -  b'Gastrointestinal enterochromaffin cells regulate bone and gut homeostasis via serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) production. A recent report suggested that gut microbes regulate 5-HT levels; however, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are unexplored. Here, we reveal that the cation channel Piezo1 in the gut acts as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) governing 5-HT production. Intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of mouse Piezo1 profoundly disturbed gut peristalsis, impeded experimental colitis, and suppressed serum 5-HT levels. Because of systemic 5-HT deficiency, conditional knockout of Piezo1 increased bone formation. Notably, fecal ssRNA was identified as a natural Piezo1 ligand, and ssRNA-stimulated 5-HT synthesis from the gut was evoked in a MyD88/TRIF-independent manner. Colonic infusion of RNase A suppressed gut motility and increased bone mass. These findings suggest gut ssRNA as a master determinant of systemic 5-HT levels, indicating the ssRNA-Peizo1 axis as a potential prophylactic target for treatment of bone and gut disorders.'

AB  -  b"The human mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 is gated by membrane tension and regulates essential biological processes such as vascular development and erythrocyte volume homeostasis. Currently, little is known about PIEZO1 plasma membrane localization and organization. Using a PIEZO1-GFP fusion protein, we investigated whether cholesterol enrichment or depletion by methyl--cyclodextrin (MBCD) and disruption of membrane cholesterol organization by dynasore affects PIEZO1-GFP's response to mechanical force. Electrophysiological recordings in the cell-attached configuration revealed that MBCD caused a rightward shift in the PIEZO1-GFP pressure-response curve, increased channel latency in response to mechanical stimuli, and markedly slowed channel inactivation. The same effects were seen in native PIEZO1 in N2A cells. STORM superresolution imaging revealed that, at the nanoscale, PIEZO1-GFP channels in the membrane associate as clusters sensitive to membrane manipulation. Both cluster distribution and diffusion rates were affected by treatment with MBCD (5 mM). Supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acids appeared to sensitize the PIEZO1-GFP response to applied pressure. Together, our results indicate that PIEZO1 function is directly dependent on the membrane composition and lateral organization of membrane cholesterol domains, which coordinate the activity of clustered PIEZO1 channels."

Recent developments have challenged this perspective, supporting the importance of post-translational modifications, and greater understanding of ion movement in these cells, that each regulate a myriad of cellular properties. There is thus now sufficient evidence to induce a step-change in understanding of RBC; rather than passively responding to the surrounding environment, these cells have the capacity to actively regulate their physical properties and thus alter blood flow.

A total of 30 genes were recurrently mutated in 3% of the cohort. Distribution of recurrently mutated genes and clonal architecture differed among MDS/MPN subtypes. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between recurrently mutated genes, as well as genotype-phenotype associations. We identified specific gene combinations that associated with distinct MDS/MPN subtypes and that were mutually exclusive with most of the other MDS/MPN (e.g. TET2-SRSF2 in CMML, ASXL1-SETBP1 in aCML or SF3B1-JAK2 in MDS/MPN-RS-T). Patients with MDS/MPN-U were the most heterogeneous and displayed different molecular profiles that mimicked the ones observed in other MDS/MPN subtypes and that had an impact on the outcome of the patients. Specific gene mutations also had an impact on the outcome of the different MDS/MPN, which may be relevant for clinical decision-making.

In this study, we generated the first BIA-ALCL patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model (IL89) and a matching continuous cell line (IL89_CL#3488) to discover potential vulnerabilities and druggable targets. We characterized IL89 and IL89_CL#3488, both phenotypically and genotypically, and demonstrated that they closely resemble the matching human primary lymphoma. The tumor content underwent significant enrichment along passages, as confirmed by the increased variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations. Known aberrations (JAK1 and KMT2C) were identified, together with novel hits, including PDGFB, PDGFRA, and SETBP1. A deep sequencing approach allowed the detection of mutations below the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) sensitivity threshold, including JAK1G1097D, in the primary sample. RNA sequencing confirmed the expression of a signature of differentially expressed genes in BIA-ALCL. Next, we tested IL89's sensitivity to the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and observed a potent anti-tumor effect, both in vitro and in vivo. We also implemented a high-throughput drug screening approach to identify compounds associated with increased responses in the presence of ruxolitinib. In conclusion, these new IL89 BIA-ALCL models closely recapitulate the primary correspondent lymphoma and represent an informative platform for dissecting the molecular features of BIA-ALCL and performing pre-clinical drug discovery studies, fostering the development of new precision medicine approaches."

AB  -  b"Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a rare, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that affects 0. 13 per 100,000 persons annually. Overall survival of SMZL is estimated to reach 8-11 years in most cases, but up to 30% of SMZL cases develop aggressive presentations resulting in greatly diminished time of survival. SMZL presents with a very heterogeneous molecular profile, making diagnosis problematic, and accurate prognosis even less likely. The study herein has identified a potential diagnostic gene expression signature with highly specific predictive utility, coined the SMZL-specific Gene Expression Signature (SSGES). Additionally, five of the most impactful markers identified within the SSGES were selected for a five-protein panel, for further evaluation among control and SMZL patient samples. These markers included EME2, ERCC5, SETBP1, USP24, and ZBTB32. When compared with control spleen and other B-cell lymphoma subtypes, significantly higher expression was noticed in SMZL samples when stained for EME2 and USP24. Additionally, ERCC5, SETBP1, USP24, and ZBTB32 staining displayed indications of prognostic value for SMZL patients. Delineation of the SSGES offers a unique SMZL signature that could provide diagnostic utility for a malignancy that has historically been difficult to identify, and the five-marker protein panel provides additional support for such findings. These results should be further investigated and validated in subsequent molecular investigations of SMZL so it may be potentially incorporated into standard oncology practice for improving the understanding and outlook for SMZL patients."

Male C57/6J mice were administered with HFD or low-fat diet (LFD) for 10 weeks, and HepG2 cells were treated with palmitate (PA, 200mM) for 24h. HFD led to abnormal hepatic steatosis and decline p-AKT and p-GSK3 by 67.1% and 66.3%, respectively. Also, not only decreased iron level but increased endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) were observed in the liver of HFD mice and that both them impaired glucose uptake and reduced the expression of p-AKT. However, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) supplementation improved hepatic IR, as well as ERS. What's more, HFD/PA depleted the labile iron pool (LIP), accumulated p62 and disturbed the expression of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) and ferritin. While NCOA4 overexpression or rapamycin improved the ERS and impaired glucose uptake in PA incubated HepG2 cells, which was abolished by NCOA4 knockdown or bafilomycin A1.

Mechanically, this effect relies on zalcitabine-induced mitochondrial DNA stress, which activates the STING1/TMEM173-mediated DNA sensing pathway, leading to macroautophagy/autophagy-dependent ferroptotic cell death via lipid peroxidation, but not a type I interferon response. Consequently, the genetic and pharmacological inactivation of the autophagy-dependent ferroptosis pathway diminishes the anticancer effects of zalcitabine in cell culture and animal models. Together, these findings not only provide a new approach for pancreatic cancer therapy but also increase our understanding of the interplay between autophagy and DNA damage response in shaping cell death.'

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the development of serrated lesions is still not well understood. Here, we combined multiple approaches to analyze the genetic alterations in 86 colorectal adenomas (including 35 sessile serrated lesions, 15 traditional adenomas, and 36 conventional adenomatous polyps). We also investigated the in vitro and in vivo oncogenic properties of a novel variant of the NCOA4-RET fusion gene. Molecular profiling revealed that sessile serrated lesions and traditional serrated adenomas have distinct clinicopathological and molecular features. Moreover, we identified receptor tyrosine kinase translocations exclusively in sessile serrated lesions (17%), and the observation was validated in a separate cohort of 34 sessile serrated lesions (15%). The kinase fusions as well as the BRAF and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive to each other. Ectopic expression of a novel variant of the NCOA4-RET fusion gene promoted cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and the proliferation was significantly suppressed by RET kinase inhibitors. All of these underscored the importance of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation in the serrated pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis. In addition, we demonstrated that the kinase fusion may occur early in the precursor lesion and subsequent loss of TP53 may drives the transformation to carcinoma during serrated tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we identified kinase fusions as a significant alternative driver of the serrated pathway in colorectal cancer development, and detecting their presence may serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis of sessile serrated lesions.  2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

To understand tissue specific contribution of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy we explored the effect of Ncoa4 genetic ablation in the iron-rich strain Sv129/J. Increased body iron content protects mice from anemia and, in basal conditions, Sv129/J Ncoa4-ko mice show only microcytosis; nevertheless, when fed a low-iron diet they develop a more severe anemia compared to wild-type animals. Reciprocal bone marrow (BM) transplantation from wild-type donors into Ncoa4-ko and from Ncoa4-ko into wild-type mice revealed that microcytosis and susceptibility to iron deficiency anemia depend on BM-derived cells. Erythropoiesis reconstitution with RBC count and hemoglobin normalization occurred at the same rate in transplanted animals independently of the genotype. Importantly, NCOA4 loss did not affect terminal erythropoiesis in iron deficiency, both in total and specific BM Ncoa4-ko animals compared to controls. On the contrary, upon a low iron diet, spleen from wild-type animals with Ncoa4-ko BM displayed marked iron retention compared to (wild-type BM) controls, indicating defective macrophage iron release in the former. Thus, EPO administration failed to mobilize iron from stores in Ncoa4-ko animals. Furthermore, Ncoa4 inactivation in thalassemic mice did not worsen the hematological phenotype. Overall our data reveal a major role for NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in macrophages to favor iron release for erythropoiesis, especially in iron deficiency.'

RET rearrangements occur in approximately 2.5-73% of sporadic PTC and 1-3% of NSCLC patients. The most common RET fusions are CDCC6-RET and NCOA4-RET in PTC and KIF5B-RET in NSCLC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are drugs that target kinases such as RET in RET-driven (RET-mutation or RET-fusion-positive) disease. Multikinase inhibitors (MKI) target various kinases and other receptors. Several MKIs are FDA-approved for cancer therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, cabozantinib, regorafenib, ponatinib, lenvatinib, alectinib) and non-oncologic disease (nintedanib). Selective RET inhibitor drugs LOXO-292 (selpercatinib) and BLU-667 (pralsetinib) are also undergoing phase I/II and I clinical trials, respectively, with preliminary results demonstrating partial response and low incidence of serious adverse events. RET fusions provide a viable therapeutic target for oncologic treatment, and further study is warranted into the prevalence and pathogenesis of RET fusions as well as development of current and new tyrosine kinase inhibitors."

A systematic literature review of pure IDCs (without stromal invasion) of low-grade (LG-IDCs) or high-grade (HG-IDCs) was performed: IDCs were classified using the apocrine (AR+/S100-) vs intercalated (S100+/AR-) classification. Eighty-two LG-IDCs and 11 HG-IDCs were identified (84% parotid; 11% oral; 3% submandibular; 1% lacrimal; and 1% unknown). Out of 11 HG-IDCs, 2 HG-IDCs (18%) recurred as HG-IDC or invasive carcinoma. IDCs were classified as follows: intercalated (30%); mixed apocrine and intercalated (27%); apocrine (11%); oncocytic (6%); intercalated with focal oncocytic features (1%); and unclassifiable (25%). Double AR/S100 expressors (4%) or discrepancies between morphology and immunophenotype (9%) were found. Apocrine features and necrosis were more frequent in HG-IDCs (55%; 45%). Pleomorphism favored HG-IDCs (especially when combined with >10mitoses/10 HPFs and/or Ki67 index >10%), being associated with apocrine areas at least in 3 HG-IDCs (27%). IDCs were typically mammaglobin+/ER-/PR-/DOG1-. No immunomarker clearly distinguished HG-IDCs from LG-IDCs. About 57% IDCs (16 LG-IDCs, 1 HG-IDC) showed RET rearrangements, including NCOA4-RET (eight intercalated and two unclassifiable IDCs) and TRIM27-RET fusions (two mixed IDCs). No ETV6, ALK-1, ROS, NTRK3, MAML2, MAML3, or PLAG1 rearrangements were identified. Complete excision and total sampling should exclude invasive areas.'

AB  -  b'Mammary glands are comprised of ducts and terminal lobules that form tree-like structures. Luminal epithelial cells in these lobules undergo differentiation into alveolar cells in pregnancy to support milk production. This study reveals that Scribble (SCRIB), a scaffold protein expressed in progesterone receptor (PGR)-positive cells, plays a critical role in mammary gland alveologenesis in mice. We conditionally deleted Scrib using a Pgr-Cre driver. PGR is heterogeneously expressed throughout the luminal epithelium. Scrib loss in mammary glands by Pgr-Cre (Scribf/fPgrCre/+) shows inefficient alveologenesis and terminal end bud (TEB)-like morphology during pregnancy, resulting in poor milk production and subsequent death of pups after delivery. The differentiation of PGR-positive epithelial cells into Elf5-expressing alveolar cells is defective in Scribf/fPgrCre/+ mice. These changes are reflected in reduced activation of JAK2 and PAK1, resulting in downregulation of pSTAT5, a critical transcriptional factor for alveologenesis. These results provide evidence that SCRIB impacts PGR-positive cell lineage during alveologenesis, which impacts milk production and the health of offspring.'

AB  -  b"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, affecting one in eight women in their lifetime. Taxane-based chemotherapy is routinely used in the treatment of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a predictive biomarker to improve the benefit/risk ratio for that cytotoxic chemotherapy. We explicitly strived for a biomarker that enables secure translation into clinical practice. We used genome-wide gene expression data of the Hatzis et al. discovery cohort of 310 patients for biomarker development and three independent cohorts with a total of 567 breast cancer patients for validation. We were able to develop a biomarker signature that consists of just the three gene products ELF5, SCUBE2 and NFIB, measured on RNA level. Compared to Hatzis et al., we achieved a significant improvement in predicting responders and non-responders in the Hatzis et al. validation cohort with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.73 [95% CI, 69%-77%]. Moreover, we could confirm the performance of our biomarker on two further independent validation cohorts. The overall performance on all three validation cohorts expressed as area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.75 [95% CI, 70%-80%]. At the clinically relevant classifier's operation point to optimize the exclusion of non-responders, the biomarker correctly predicts three out of four patients not responding to neoadjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy, independent of the breast cancer subtype. At the same time, the response rate in the group of predicted responders increased to 42% compared to 23% response rate in all patients of the validation cohorts."

Ovarian cancer tissues of 300 epithelial ovarian cancer patients and the adjacent normal tissues were analyzed. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expressions of WWOX, Elf5, Snail1 and EMT marker molecules in the specimens. The relationship between the indicators and clinicopathological parameters, and prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer was analyzed. The relationship between WWOX, Elf5, Snail1 and EMT marker molecules E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin in ovarian cancer tissues was analyzed. The expression levels of WWOX, Elf5, Snail1 and EMT marker molecules in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues were significantly different from those in adjacent normal tissues, and were related to surgical pathological stage, pathological grade and lymph node metastasis. High expressions of WWOX and Elf5 were related to the survival rate of patients. The survival rate of patients with positive expression was significantly higher than that of negative expression. FIGO stage, pathological grade, lymph node metastasis and expression of WWOX and Elf5 were all independent factors affecting postoperative prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. In conclusion, the expression levels of WWOX, Elf5, Snail1 and EMT related factors in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues are consistent and different.

TI  -  b'ELF5 modulates the estrogen receptor cistrome in breast cancer.'
AB  -  b'Acquired resistance to endocrine therapy is responsible for half of the therapeutic failures in the treatment of breast cancer. Recent findings have implicated increased expression of the ETS transcription factor ELF5 as a potential modulator of estrogen action and driver of endocrine resistance, and here we provide the first insight into the mechanisms by which ELF5 modulates estrogen sensitivity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing we found that ELF5 binding overlapped with FOXA1 and ER at super enhancers, enhancers and promoters, and when elevated, caused FOXA1 and ER to bind to new regions of the genome, in a pattern that replicated the alterations to the ER/FOXA1 cistrome caused by the acquisition of resistance to endocrine therapy. RNA sequencing demonstrated that these changes altered estrogen-driven patterns of gene expression, the expression of ER transcription-complex members, and 6 genes known to be involved in driving the acquisition of endocrine resistance. Using rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins, and proximity ligation assays, we found that ELF5 interacted physically with members of the ER transcription complex, such as DNA-PKcs. We found 2 cases of endocrine-resistant brain metastases where ELF5 levels were greatly increased and ELF5 patterns of gene expression were enriched, compared to the matched primary tumour. Thus ELF5 alters ER-driven gene expression by modulating the ER/FOXA1 cistrome, by interacting with it, and by modulating the expression of members of the ER transcriptional complex, providing multiple mechanisms by which ELF5 can drive endocrine resistance.'

Here, we identify UNC-44/ankyrin as an essential component of the TMC-1 mechanotransduction channel complex in the sensory cilia of Caenorhabditis elegans mechanoreceptor neurons. Ankyrin binds indirectly to TMC-1 via evolutionarily conserved CIB proteins, which are required for TMC-1-mediated mechanosensation in C.elegans OLQ neurons and body wall muscles. Mechanosensory activity conferred by ectopically expressed TMCs in mechanoinsensitive neurons depends on both ankyrin and CIB proteins, indicating that the ankyrin-CIB subcomplex is required for TMC mechanosensitivity. Our work indicates that ankyrin is a long-sought intracellular tether that transmits force to TMC mechanotransduction channels.'

AB  -  b'Perception of sound is initiated by mechanically-gated ion channels at the tips of stereocilia. Mature mammalian auditory hair cells require transmembrane channel-like 1 (TMC1) for mechanotransduction and mutations of the cognate genetic sequences result in dominant or recessive heritable deafness forms in humans and mice. In contrast, zebrafish lateral line hair cells, which detect water motion, require Tmc2a and Tmc2b. Here, we use standard and multiplex genome editing in conjunction with functional and behavioral assays to determine the reliance of zebrafish hearing and vestibular organs on Tmc proteins. Surprisingly, our approach using multiple mutant alleles demonstrates that hearing in zebrafish is not dependent on Tmc1, nor is it fully dependent on Tmc2a and Tmc2b. Hearing however is absent in triple-knockout zebrafish that lack Tmc1, Tmc2a, and Tmc2b. These outcomes reveal a striking resemblance of Tmc protein reliance in the vestibular sensory epithelia of mammals to the maculae of zebrafish. Moreover, our findings disclose a logic of Tmc use where hearing depends on a complement of Tmc proteins beyond those employed to sense water motion.'

Approximately 50% of congenital deafness is hereditary and about half of genetic deafness is still unsolved. To date, more than 150 genes are known to cause hearing loss worldwide, with specific genes contributing to deafness in distinct populations. Of these, more than 20 genes are involved in deafness among the Jewish Israeli hearing-impaired population. The most common gene in many worldwide populations, including Israel, is GJB2, which encodes the connexin 26 protein. The second most common gene among Jews is TMC1, with most pathogenic variants found only among Jews of Moroccan origin. Most other pathogenic variants found in the Jewish population are origin-specific and not found in other Jewish ethnic groups or in other worldwide populations. In patients where hereditary deafness is suspected, known variants in the specific ethnicity are routinely examined. In Israel, the GJB2 gene is screened in all cases of hereditary deafness and the TMC1 gene is screened in deaf persons of Jewish Moroccan origin. In cases where no variant is found in a known gene, more comprehensive diagnostic tests should be used. Since the beginning of the deep sequencing era, less than a decade ago, the number of deafness-related genes in the Jewish population has increased by threefold. Identifying the pathogenic variant makes it possible to study molecular pathogenesis, to anticipate and understand the prognosis, to calculate probability of concomitant morbidity, to offer prenatal diagnosis, prevent recurrence of deafness in the family and early rehabilitation. Currently, cochlear implant offers the greatest chance for rehabilitation. The hope is that understanding the molecular pathogenesis will in the future lead to personalized medical treatment.

The more commonly performed methods of crude oil fractionation are often insufficient in the extent to which they separate oils, not allowing defined "molecular" fractions to be obtained. Methods capable of performing a class type separation are uncommon and are often extensive and resource and time intensive. Here we report a method for the separation of crude oils into discrete compound classes. The method utilizes both ion exchange and normal phase chromatography to generate fractions of saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, basic compounds, naphthenic acids, and other oxygen-containing species, carbazoles, sulfones, and thiophenes from small crude oil samples (0.5 g). Assessment of method selectivity with a suite of model compounds has shown the fractions to be well-defined, with classes of model compounds isolated within discrete fractions. Application of the method to five crude oils of varying API gravity (12.1-38.3) demonstrates a potential for wide-ranging use. Sample recoveries were high (77-98%) with simple evaporative losses correlating closely with total sample loss. Repeatability was also high, demonstrated by triplicate analyses of model compound mixtures, oils spiked with model compounds and oils alone. Separation selectivity was further demonstrated by application of the scheme to the Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil and analysis of fractions by comprehensive two-dimensional gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC  GC/MS) and/or liquid-chromatography high-resolution accurate-mass mass-spectrometry methods (LC-HRAM-MS).

The objective of this paper is to provide original, real, full-scale data obtained for removal of metals during aerobic biological leachate treatment, and also to report on studies carried out to look at further trace metal removal. Polishing technologies examined and investigated include; the incorporation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes into biological treatment systems, the use of ion exchange, and of activated carbon polishing processes. Ultrafiltration was able to provide a 60 percent reduction in COD values in treated leachates, compared with COD values found in settled/clarified effluents. Removal rates for COD varied from 30.5 to 79.8 percent. Additionally, ultrafiltration of treated leachates significantly reduced both chromium and nickel concentrations of effluents by 61.6% and 34.3% respectively (median values). Despite mean reductions of chromium (9.7%) and nickel (13.7%) noted during the ion exchange trials, these results would not justify use of this technology for metals removal at full-scale. Further preliminary studies used pulverized activated carbon (PAC) polishing of UF effluents to demonstrate that significant (up to 80 per cent) removal of COD, TOC and heavy metals could readily be achieved by doses of up to 10g/l of suitable activated carbons. Additional evidence is provided that many trace metals are present not in ionic form, but as organic complexes; this is likely to make their removal to low levels more difficult and expensive.'

In these breeds, few sires have progeny records, and genotyping cows can improve the accuracy of genomic EBV. The Guernsey breed is a small dairy cattle breed with approximately 14,000 recorded individuals worldwide. Predictions of phenotypes of milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, and calving interval were made for Guernsey cows from England and Guernsey Island using genomic EBV, with training sets including 197 de-regressed proofs of genotyped bulls, with cows selected from among 1,440 genotyped cows using different genotyping strategies. Accuracies of predictions were tested using 10-fold cross-validation among the cows. Genomic EBV were predicted using 4 different methods: (1) pedigree BLUP, (2) genomic BLUP using only bulls, (3) univariate genomic BLUP using bulls and cows, and (4) bivariate genomic BLUP. Genotyping cows with phenotypes and using their data for the prediction of single nucleotide polymorphism effects increased the correlation between genomic EBV and phenotypes compared with using only bulls by 0.1630.022 for milk yield, 0.1110.021 for fat yield, and 0.1130.018 for protein yield; a decrease of 0.0140.010 for calving interval from a low base was the only exception. Genetic correlation between phenotypes from bulls and cows were approximately 0.6 for all yield traits and significantly different from 1. Only a very small change occurred in correlation between genomic EBV and phenotypes when using the bivariate model. It was always better to genotype all the cows, but when only half of the cows were genotyped, a divergent selection strategy was better compared with the random or directional selection approach. Divergent selection of 30% of the cows remained superior for the yield traits in 8 of 10 folds.'

There were 88, 14, 27, and 20 bacterial genera associated with the intestinal tract of PL15, J1, J2 and J3, respectively. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that Proteobacteria (class Gammaproteobacteria) was a dominant bacteria group with a relative abundance of 89% for PL15 and 99% for J1, J2 and J3. Real-time PCR assay also confirmed that Gammaproteobacteria had the highest relative abundance in intestines from all growth stages. Intestinal bacterial communities from the three juvenile stages were more similar to each other than that of the PL shrimp based on PCA analyses of pyrosequencing results and their DGGE profiles. This study provides descriptive bacterial communities associated to the black tiger shrimp intestines during these growth development stages in rearing facilities.'

AB  -  b'Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical regulators in tumor initiation and progression. However, the biological mechanisms and potential clinical application of lncRNA NORAD in endometrial cancer (EC) remain unknown. Herein, we identified NORAD underwent promoter hypermethylation-associated downregulation in EC. Epigenetic inactivation of NORAD was correlated with EC progression (FIGO stage) and poor outcome. Overexpression of NORAD significantly inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in EC cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that multiple regions of NORAD served as a platform for binding with the central domain of anti-apoptotic factor FUBP1. Our findings further indicated that the NORAD/FUBP1 interaction attenuated FUBP1 nuclear localization and thus impaired the occupancies of FUBP1 on its target pro-apoptotic gene promoters, resulting in apoptosis induction in EC. Moreover, knockdown of NORAD promoted tumor growth in the xenograft mice model. While, introduction of NORAD-4 fragment, which bound with FUBP1, successfully reversed tumor growth and apoptosis inhibition mediated by NORAD knockdown in vivo. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the critical roles of NORAD as a tumor suppressor in EC progression. NORAD could possibly serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and provide the rationale for EC therapy.'

TI  -  b'Multiple Functions of Fubp1 in Cell Cycle Progression and Cell Survival.'
AB  -  b'The discovery of novel and critical genes implicated in malignant development is a topic of high interest in cancer research. Intriguingly, a group of genes named "double-agent" genes were reported to have both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive functions. To date, less than 100 "double-agent" genes have been documented. Fubp1 is a master transcriptional regulator of a subset of genes by interacting with a far upstream element (FUSE). Mounting evidence has collectively demonstrated both the oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles of Fubp1 and the debate regarding its roles in tumorigenesis has been around for several years. Therefore, the detailed molecular mechanisms of Fubp1 need to be determined in each context. In the present study, we showed that the Fubp1 protein level was enriched in the S phase and we identified that Fubp1 deficiency altered cell cycle progression, especially in the S phase, by downregulating the mRNA expression levels of '

TI  -  b'Far Upstream Element-Binding Protein 1 Facilitates Hepatocellular Carcinoma Invasion and Metastasis.'
AB  -  b'Previous research suggests that Far Upstream-element Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1)plays an important role in various tumors including Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of FUBP1 in liver cancer remains controversial, and the regulatory pathway by FUBP1 awaits to be determined. This study aims to identify the role of FUBP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Our result shows that high level of FUBP1 expression in HCC predicts poor prognosis after surgery. Overexpression of FUBP1 promotes HCC proliferation, invasion and metastasis by activating Transforming Growth Gactor-(TGF-)/Smad pathway and enhancing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. Inhibitor of Thrombospondin-1 (LSKL)could inhibit HCC proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo by blocking the activation of TGF-/Smad pathway mediated by Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1). Our study identified the critical role of FUBP1-THBS1-TGF- signaling axis in HCC and provides potentially new therapeutic modalities in HCC.'

They have also revealed a class of mutations in understudied, infrequently altered genes, referred to as "long tail" (LT) drivers. A key challenge has been to find clinically relevant LT drivers and to understand how they cooperate to drive disease. Here, we identified far upstream binding protein 1 (FUBP1) as an LT driver using an invivo CRISPR screen. FUBP1 cooperates with other tumor suppressor genes to transform mammary epithelial cells by disrupting cellular differentiation and tissue architecture. Mechanistically, FUBP1 participates in regulating N'

TI  -  b'CRISPR/Cas-mediated Fubp1 silencing disrupts circadian oscillation of Per1 protein via downregulating Syncrip expression.'
AB  -  b'Most living organisms have physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms controlled by molecular clocks. In mammals, several core clock genes show self-perpetuating oscillation profiles of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins through anauto-regulatory transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL). As a critical component in the molecular clock system, Period 1 (Per1) contributes to the maintenance of circadian rhythm duration predominantly in peripheral clocks. Alterations in Per1 expression and oscillating patterns lead to the development of cancers as well as circadian rhythm abnormalities. In this study, we demonstrate that the phasic profile of Per1 protein was clearly disrupted in CRISPR/Cas-mediated Fubp1-deficient cells. Although Fubp1 does not show rhythmic expression, Fubp1 upregulates the mRNA and protein level of Syncrip, the main post-transcriptional regulator of Per1 protein oscillation. In addition to the diverse physiological functions of Fubp1, including cell-cycle regulation and cellular metabolic control, our results suggest new roles forFubp1 in the molecular clock system.'

AB  -  b'Diabetic animal models have made significant contributions to understanding the etiology of diabetes and to the development of new medications. Our research group recently developed a novel diabetic mouse strain, the insulin hyposecretion (ihs)mouse. The strain involves neither obesity nor insulitis but exhibits notable pancreatic -cell dysfunction, distinguishing it from other well-characterized animal models. In ihs mice, severe impairment of insulin secretion from pancreas has been elicited by glucose or potassium chloride stimulation. To clarify the genetic basis of impaired insulin secretion, beginning with identifying the causative gene, genetic linkage analysis was performed using [(C57BL/6  ihs) F1  ihs] backcross progeny. Genetic linkage analysis and quantitative trait loci analysis for blood glucose after oral glucose loading indicated that a recessively acting locus responsible for impaired glucose tolerance was mapped to a 14.9-Mb region of chromosome 18 between D18Mit233 and D18Mit235 (the ihs locus). To confirm the gene responsible for the ihs locus, a congenic strain harboring the ihs locus on the C57BL/6 genetic background was developed. Phenotypic analysis of B6.ihs-(D18Mit233-D18Mit235) mice showed significant glucose tolerance impairment and markedly lower plasma insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test. Whole-genome sequencing and Sanger sequencing analyses on the ihs genome detected two ihs-specific variants changing amino acids within the ihs locus; both variants in Slc25a46 and Tcerg1 were predicted to disrupt the protein function. Based on information regarding gene functions involving diabetes mellitus and insulin secretion, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Reep2 and Sil1 transcripts from ihs islets was significantly decreased whereas that of Syt4 transcripts were significantly increased compared with those of control C57BL/6 mice. Thus, Slc25a46, Tcerg1, Syt4, Reep2 and Sil1 are potential candidate genes for the ihs locus. This will be the focus of future studies in both mice and humans.'

AB  -  b'Retrotransposon insertion in Brachytic2 generated a new incomplete recessive dwarf allele after spaceflight can moderately reduce plant height in heterozygous and potentially improve maize yield. Plant height and ear height are two important agronomic traits in maize breeding. In this study, two dwarf mutants short internode length1 (sil1) and short internode length2 (sil2) were obtained from two of 398 spaceflighted seeds of inbred line 18-599. The decrease in longitudinal cell number and cell length led to the shortened internodes of sil1 and sil2. A Ty1-copia LTR-retrotransposon, termed ZmRE-1, inserted in the fifth exon of Brachytic2 (Br2) was identified in sil1 and sil2 at exactly the same site, which indicated the transposition of ZmRE-1 probably correlated with the spaceflight. This new dwarf mutant allele was named as br2-sil in this study. The insertion of ZmRE-1 not only led to the loss of normal transcript of Br2 allele, but also reduced the transcript expression of br2-sil allele. Chop-qPCR displayed that the promoter region DNA methylation level of br2-sil allele in sil1 was higher than that of Br2 allele in WT-sil1. We speculated that the increased methylation level might downregulate the br2-sil expression. There was no difference in the seed-setting rate between sil1 and WT-sil1. Meanwhile, br2-sil could reduce plant and ear height effectively in Br2/br2-sil genotype without negative effects on grain yield. Therefore, the application of br2-sil in breeding has the potential to improve the grain yield per unit area through increasing the planting density.'

AB  -  b'Breast cancer, as one of the most malignant tumors, poses a serious threat to the lives of females. Nucleotide exchange factor SIL1 is an important regulator of endoplasmic reticulum function that might have a specific role in tumor progression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of SIL1 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis of human breast cancer. SIL1-specific small interfering RNA was transfected into two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, to generate SIL1 knockdown cells. Clone formation and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were performed to determine cell proliferation. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to detect the cell migration and invasion, respectively. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. The messenger RNA and protein levels of target genes were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. According to the results of TCGA and GTEx database analysis, we determined that SIL1 was overexpressed in 1085 breast cancer samples compared with 291 normal samples. Knockdown of SIL1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, accordingly. The cell cycle was blocked at the G1 phase following transfection of SIL1-specific small interfering RNA through the inhibition of Cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6. SIL1 knockdown induced apoptosis and also promoted the activity of Caspase9 and Bax. Furthermore, SIL1 was able to promote phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Based on these results, SIL1 might act as an oncogene and accelerate the progression of human breast cancer.'

TI  -  b'Review: Protein misfolding diseases - the rare case of Marinesco-Sjgren syndrome.'
AB  -  b'Secretory and cell membrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where a network of molecular chaperones and folding factors ensure correct protein folding and export to post-ER compartments. Failure of this process leads to accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins, ER stress, and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex signalling pathway aimed at restoring ER homeostasis, whose failure eventually leads to cell death. Suppressor of Ire1/Lhs1 double mutant (SIL1) is a nucleotide exchange factor for immunoglobulin binding protein, the main ER chaperone and primary sensor of ER stress. Loss of SIL1 function causes Marinesco-Sjgren syndrome (MSS), a rare multisystem disease of early infancy for which there is no cure. This review, examines the current understanding of SIL1 activities in the ER, and reviews experimental data describing the consequences of SIL1 deficiency in cell and animal models. We discuss the evidence supporting a role of the UPR - particularly the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase branch - in the pathogenesis of MSS, and how this may be pharmacologically manipulated for treatment.'

As BiP is decisive for proper protein processing, loss of SIL1 results in the accumulation of misshaped proteins. This accumulation likely damages and destroys cells in vulnerable tissues, leading to congenital cataracts, cerebellar ataxia, vacuolar myopathy and other MSS phenotypes. Whether the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is affected in MSS has not been conclusively shown.'
